# GitHub User Search
> Created using [Python3](https://python.org) and [git_api](https://pypi.org/project/git-api/), coded by [JBYT27](https://github.com/JBYT27).

> **IMPORTANT: You must fork the Repl to access it as of right now. If you are viewing this on GitHub, this should be the same as well. Thank you in advance!**


## About
This is a project I decided to make for Kajam, but I decided to choose a different idea for the jam, so this is just your ordinary project. (*You can find the package [here](https://pypi.org/project/git-api/).*) So this is basically a clone of @RayhanADev's [Replit User Search](https://replit-user-search-v3.rayhanadev.repl.co/). I tried recreating that, but it retrieves GitHub user info. You just insert your name inside the textbox, press the search button, and it should retrive the GitHub user info!

> _**Please note that it takes a few times to reload for the correct information to come up. We will try to solve that problem as soon as we can. Thank you!**_

## Using it
Unfortunately, as of right now, you need to **fork** the repl. I am working on fixing that error, but it is still functional (when you fork it.). Please enjoy using it, and leave suggestions in the comments as well! Thanks!
