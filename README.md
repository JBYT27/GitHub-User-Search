## About
This is a project I decided to make for Kajam, but I decided to choose a different idea for the jam, so this is just your ordinary project. (*You can find the package [here](https://pypi.org/project/git-api/).*) So this is basically a clone of [RayhanADev](https://replit.com/@rayhanadev)'s [Replit User Search](https://replit-user-search-v3.rayhanadev.repl.co/). I tried recreating that, but it retrieves GitHub user info. You just insert your name inside the textbox, press the search button, and it should retrive the GitHub user info!
