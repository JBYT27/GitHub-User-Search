# GitHub User Search - Search all the GitHub users!
![Home](.github/imgs/home.png)
> Created using [Python3](https://python.org) and [git_api](https://pypi.org/project/git-api/), coded by [JBYT27](https://github.com/JBYT27) and [DillonB07](https://github.com/DillonB07).


## About
This project was first an idea for KaJam, however, I got stumped on a problem, so I couldn't submit it in time. So I decided to continue coding it *out* of the jam! Basically, this is just a clone of @RayhanADev's [Replit User Search](https://replit-user-search-v3.rayhanadev.repl.co/). The difference is, this retrieves GitHub user data instead :D

## Using it
All you need to do is enter a GitHub username in the textbox, press the search button, and the data will come up. Feel free to leave suggestions! Thanks!

> Open it in a [**new tab**](https://github-user-search.jbloves27.repl.co/) to access it!
